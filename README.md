## Motivation

Machine Learning is the most transformative technology of our time. Whether its helping us discover new drugs for major diseases,
fighting fraud, generating music, improving supply chain efficiency, the list of applications are truly endless. In order for us as a community

will light a movement to radically improve the state of humanity. 100 Days of ML Code is a committment to better your understanding of
this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of your time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days. 

## Eligibility 

- Everyone is eligible, even people who've never coded before

## The 3 Rules

- Make a public pledge to code or study machine learning for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 100 days via your favorite social platform using the [#100DaysofMLCode](https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1014758160572141568) Hashtag.
- Make a public log of your work. Update it daily. Here is a GitHub example [template](https://gist.github.com/llSourcell/43194e486a92532bc343f7837b178eda). Another one is [here](https://github.com/LordSomen/100DaysOfML/blob/master/Log.md). You can also
make a blog or vlog. 
- If you see someone make a post using the #100DaysofMLCode hashtag, encourage them via a 'like', 'share', or comment!
